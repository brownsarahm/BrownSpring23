# Regression Preview 


## Preview Regression
- [the beginning of sklearn's regression tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares) carefully. and skim the rest of it. 
- [the linear regression example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py). cut this code into multiple cells and run it, looking at interim points. 
- the example page [from this stat course](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/101/)

## Be ready for Thursday
- what are the assumptions of regression generally?
- what are the specific assumptions of linear regression?
- what does data for regression need to have in terms of variable types? 
- what are at least three example applications of regression that are not included in the resources above?
