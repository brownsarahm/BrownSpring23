# SVM and Model Optimization

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import cluster
from sklearn import svm, datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import tree
```

If we have 500 samples and use `train_size=.8` in `train_test_split` and the default values for `GridSearchCV`, how many samples are in each validation set?

```{code-cell} ipython3
N = 500
train_size = .8
cv = 5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
train_size*N/cv
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_X, iris_y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_X_train, iris_X_test, iris_y_train, iris_y_test = train_test_split(iris_X,iris_y)
```


## Fitting an SVM

Now let's compare with a different model, we'll use the parameter optimized version for that model.

[the sklearn docs have a good description](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)

```{code-cell} ipython3
svm_clf = svm.SVC()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
param_grid = {'kernel':['linear','rbf'], 'C':[.5, 1, 10]}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
svm_opt = GridSearchCV(svm_clf,param_grid)
svm_opt.fit(iris_X_train,iris_y_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
svm_df = pd.DataFrame(svm_opt.cv_results_)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
svm_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
svm_opt.best_params_
```



## Other ways to compare models

We can look at the performance, here the score is the accuracy and we could also look at other performance metrics.

We can compare them on time: the training time or the test time (more important).

We can also compare models on their interpretability: a decision tree is easy to explain how it makes a decision.  


We can compare if it is generative (describes the data, could generate synthetic data) or discriminative (describes the decision rule). A generative model might be preferred even with lower accuracy by a scientist who wants to understand the data.  It can also help to give ideas about what you might do to improve the model.  If you just need the most accuracy, like if you are placing ads, you would typically use a discriminative model because it is complex, and you just want accuracy you don't need to understand.
