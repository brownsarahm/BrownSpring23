# Predictions with niave Bayes and Decision Trees



```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn import metrics
iris_df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```

## Classifying Irises

```{code-cell} ipython3
iris_df.head()
```

Our goal is to predict the *species* from the *measurements*. In machine learning, we call the species the *target* variable. The three species of irises, setosa, virginica and versicolor are called the *classes*. Since the target variable is categorical, this prediction task is a classification problem.  

````{margin}
```{hint}
I set the size of the training data here to 80% instead of the default 75%. 
I did not do this in class, but since the assignment asks you to change the training size, I included it here. 
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
# dataset vars:
# 'petal_width',  'sepal_length','species', 'sepal_width','petal_length',
feature_vars = ['petal_width',  'sepal_length', 'sepal_width','petal_length',]
target_var = 'species'
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris_df[feature_vars],iris_df[target_var],random_state=0,train_size=.8)
```

Using the `random_state` makes it so that we get the same "random" set each type we run the code. [see docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html#:~:text=the%20test%20size.-,random_state,-int%2C%20RandomState%20instance)


Notice that in the training data the indices are randomly ordered unlike in the original DataFrame. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
X_train.head()
```

Next we can instantiate our [estimator object](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-estimators) which in this case is the [`GaussianNB`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html)
````{margin}
```{note}
The sklearn docs (and the docstring) include the reference to the exact implementation that they use, including the original research paper that discovered and evaluated that algorithm
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb = GaussianNB()
gnb.fit(X_train,y_train)
```
We use the fit method to "learn" or find the values of the parameters. 


```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.score(X_test,y_test)
```
Then we can check how well it works

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)
```
And see the atual predictions

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_pred == y_test
```

## How does GNB make predictions? 

we fit the Gaussian Naive Bayes, it computes a mean
$\theta$ and variance $\sigma$ and adds them to model parameters in attributes
```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.__dict__
```

The attributes of the [estimator object](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-estimators) (`gbn`) describe the data (eg the class list) and the model's parameters. The `theta_` ($\theta$)
represents the mean and the `var_` ($\sigma$) represents the variance of the
distributions.  

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.theta_
```


```{admonition} Try it Yourself
Could you use what we learned about EDA to find the mean and variance of each
feature for each species of flower?
```


Because the GaussianNB classifier calculates parameters that describe the
assumed distribuiton of the data is is called a generative classifier.  From a
generative classifer, we can generate synthetic data that is from the
distribution the classifer learned. If this data looks like our real data, then
the model assumptions fit well.

```{warning}
the details of this math are not required understanding, but this describes the
following block of code

```
````{margin}
```{hint}
to try understanding this block of code, try extracting pieces of it and running
each piece individually. I built it up piece by piece adn then wrapped them all
together.
```
````
To do this, we extract the mean and variance parameters from the model
(`gnb.theta_,gnb.sigma_`) and `zip` them together to create an iterable object
that in each iteration returns one value from each list (`for th, sig in zip(gnb.theta_,gnb.sigma_)`).
We do this inside of a list comprehension and for each `th,sig` where `th` is
from `gnb.theta_` and `sig` is from `gnb.sigma_` we use `np.random.multivariate_normal`
to get 20 samples. In a general [multivariate normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) the second parameter is actually a covariance
matrix.  This describes both the variance of each individual feature and the
correlation of the features.  Since Naive Bayes is Naive it assumes the features
are independent or have 0 correlation.  So, to create the matrix from the vector
of variances we multiply by `np.eye(4)` which is the identity matrix or a matrix
with 1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. Finally we stack the groups for each
species together with `np.concatenate` (like `pd.concat` but works on numpy objects
  and `np.random.multivariate_normal` returns numpy arrays not data frames) and put all of that in a
DataFrame using the feature names as the columns.

Then we add a species column, by repeating each species 20 times
`[c]*N for c in gnb.classes_` and then unpack that into a single list instead of
as list of lists.  

```{code-cell} ipython3
N = 50
gnb_df = pd.DataFrame(np.concatenate([np.random.multivariate_normal(th, sig*np.eye(4),N)
                 for th, sig in zip(gnb.theta_,gnb.var_)]),
                 columns = gnb.feature_names_in_)
gnb_df['species'] = [ci for cl in [[c]*N for c in gnb.classes_] for ci in cl]
sns.pairplot(data =gnb_df, hue='species')
```


````{margin}
```{admonition} Further Reading
There are other classifiers that use roughly the same model but don't make the
naive assumption. The more flexible is called Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
- [mathematical formulation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html#lda-qda-math) for both
- [QDA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis.html#sklearn.discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis) code
- [LDA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.html#sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis) code
```
````
```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.pairplot(data=iris_df,hue='species')
```


This one looks pretty close to the actual data.  The biggest difference is that
these data are all in uniformly circular-ish blobs and the ones above are not.  
That means that the naive assumption doesn't hold perfectly on this data.  

When we use the predict method, it uses those parameters to calculate the
likelihood of the sample according to a Gaussian distribution (normal) for each class and then calculates the probability of the sample belonging to each class and returns the one with the highest probability.



## Interpretting probabilities

We can look directly at the probabilities 
```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb.predict_proba(X_test)
```

We can see that for most of these one value is close to one and the others are close to zero.  One way to emphasize this is to round them. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_prob = gnb.predict_proba(X_test)
np.round(y_prob,2)
```

```{important}
The following did not happen in class, but I added more explanation so tha it is more clear.
```

These are hard to interpret as is, one option is to plot them

```{code-cell} ipython3
# make the prbabilities into a dataframe labeled with classes & make the index a separate column
prob_df = pd.DataFrame(data = gnb.predict_proba(X_test), columns = gnb.classes_ ).reset_index()
# add the predictions
prob_df['predicted_species'] = y_pred
prob_df['true_species'] = y_test.values
# for plotting, make a column that combines the index & prediction
pred_text = lambda r: str( r['index']) + ',' + r['predicted_species']
prob_df['i,pred'] = prob_df.apply(pred_text,axis=1)
# same for ground truth
true_text = lambda r: str( r['index']) + ',' + r['true_species']
prob_df['correct'] = prob_df['predicted_species'] == prob_df['true_species']
# a dd a column for which are correct
prob_df['i,true'] = prob_df.apply(true_text,axis=1)
prob_df_melted = prob_df.melt(id_vars =[ 'index', 'predicted_species','true_species','i,pred','i,true','correct'],value_vars = gnb.classes_,
                             var_name = target_var, value_name = 'probability')
prob_df_melted.head()
```

Now we have a data frame where each rown is one the probability of one sample belonging to one class. So there's a total of `number_of_samples*number_of_classes` rows

```{code-cell} ipython3
prob_df_melted.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(y_pred)*len(gnb.classes_)
```

One way to look at these is to, for each sample in the test set, make a bar chart of the probability it belongs to each class.  We added to the data frame information so that we can plot this with the true class in the title using `col = 'i,true'`

````{margin}
```{tip}
I used `set_theme` to change both the fond size and the color palette.
Seaborn has a [detailed guide](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html#palette-tutorial)
for choosing colors. The `colorblind` palette uses colors that are distinguishable under most common
forms of color blindness.
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
sns.set_theme(font_scale=2, palette= "colorblind")
# plot a bar graph for each point labeled with the prediction
sns.catplot(data =prob_df_melted, x = 'species', y='probability' ,col ='i,true',
            col_wrap=5,kind='bar')
```

We see that most sampples have nearly all of their probability mass (all probabiilties in a distribution sum (or integrate if continuous) to 1, but a few samples are not.  

## What about a harder dataset? 

Using a toy dataset here shows an easy to see challenge for the classifier that we have seen so far.  Real datasets will be hard in different ways, and since they're higher dimensional, it's harder to visualize the cause.
```{code-cell} ipython3
corner_data = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/06-naive-bayes/f425ba121cc0c4dd8bcaa7ebb2ff0b40b0b03bff/data/dataset6.csv'
df6= pd.read_csv(corner_data,usecols=[1,2,3])
gnb_corners = GaussianNB()
sns.pairplot(data=df6, hue='char',hue_order=['A','B'])
```
As we can see in this dataset, these classes are quite separated. We might expect a pretty good performance. 
```{code-cell} ipython3
df6.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
Xcorners_train, Xcorners_test, ycorners_train, ycorners_test = train_test_split(
                df6.drop(columns='char'),df6['char'])
gnb_corners.fit(Xcorners_train,ycorners_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gnb_corners.score(Xcorners_test,ycorners_test)
```


But we do not get a very good classification score.

To see why, we can look at what it learned.


```{code-cell} ipython3
N = 100
gnb_corners_df = pd.DataFrame(np.concatenate([np.random.multivariate_normal(th, sig*np.eye(2),N)
         for th, sig in zip(gnb_corners.theta_,gnb.sigma_)]),
         columns = ['x0','x1'])
gnb_corners_df['char'] = [ci for cl in [[c]*N for c in gnb_corners.classes_] for ci in cl]

sns.pairplot(data =gnb_corners_df, hue='char',hue_order=['A','B'])
```

## Decision Trees

The Gaussian Naive Bayes model we have seen so far, worked on this really well separated Gaussian distributed data.  Not all data is that easy to classify. Sometimes coming up with a description of the data for a generative model is hard and it might not even be important.  A scientist will find that valuable, but it is not always needed. Another way to think about classification is to focus on writing a rule (or set of rules) for determining the label from the features.  This type of classifier is called discriminative, because it focuses on discriminating (in the literal, differentiate sense, not the socially loaded differentiate on the basis of an attribute of the person in unfair ways sense) between the classes. 

This data does not fit the assumptions of the Niave Bayes model, but a decision tree has a different rule. It can be more complex, but for the scikit learn one relies on splitting the data at a series of points along one axis at a time.  

It is a **discriminative** model, because it describes how to discriminate (in the sense of differentiate) between the classes.


```{code-cell} ipython3

from sklearn import tree
```
The sklearn estimator objects (that correspond to different models) all have the same API, so the `fit`, `predict`, and `score` methods are the same as above. We will see this also in regression and clustering.  What each method does in terms of the specific calculations will vary depending on the model, but they're always there.  
```{code-cell} ipython3
dt = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt.fit(Xcorners_train,ycorners_train)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
dt.score(Xcorners_test,ycorners_test)
```




The `tree` module also allows you to plot the tree to examine it.


```{code-cell} ipython3
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.figure(figsize=(15,20))
tree.plot_tree(dt, rounded =True, class_names = ['A','B'],
            proportion=True, filled =True, impurity=False,fontsize=10)
```


````{margin}
```{note}
On the iris dataset, the [sklearn docs include a diagram showing the decision boundary](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_iris_dtc.html) You should be able to modify this for another classifier.

```
````

## Setting Classifier Parameters

The decision tree we had above has a lot more layers than we would expect.  This is really simple data so we still got perfect classification. However, the more complex the model, the more risk that it will learn something noisy about the training data that doesn't hold up in the test set.  

Fortunately, we can control the parameters to make it find a simpler decision boundary.

```{code-cell} ipython3
dt2 = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
dt2.fit(Xcorners_train,ycorners_train)
dt2.score(Xcorners_test,ycorners_test)
```


We might need to play with different parameters to get it just how we want it.  A simpler model can be better because it  is easier to understand and sometimes will generalize, or apply to new data, better. 



## Example Loading UCI data


```{hint}
This is a hint for a7
```

Remember in classification, we predict a cateogrical variable from related continuous feature variables. 


The data is a `.data` file, but if you look at it, it will actually be comma, tab, or space delimited, so `read_csv` will work. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_csv('glass.data').head()
```

I would notice that the first row is data, not headers so I would  go to the `glass.names` file to find the column names

+++

in the glass.names file there is a lot of other information, but the important part is a list of the columns: 
```
   1. Id number: 1 to 214
   2. RI: refractive index
   3. Na: Sodium (unit measurement: weight percent in corresponding oxide, as 
                  are attributes 4-10)
   4. Mg: Magnesium
   5. Al: Aluminum
   6. Si: Silicon
   7. K: Potassium
   8. Ca: Calcium
   9. Ba: Barium
  10. Fe: Iron
  11. Type of glass:
```

+++

If I were going to work on this, I would copy that section into a string and then delete that () section after sodium.

```{code-cell} ipython3
names= '''   1. Id number: 1 to 214
   2. RI: refractive index
   3. Na: Sodium 
   4. Mg: Magnesium
   5. Al: Aluminum
   6. Si: Silicon
   7. K: Potassium
   8. Ca: Calcium
   9. Ba: Barium
  10. Fe: Iron
  11. Type of glass:'''
```

Then instead of cutting each one to make a list manually, I might do the following: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
col_names = [cn.split('.')[1].split(':')[0].strip().replace(' ','_') 
             for cn in names.split('\n')]
col_names
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.read_csv('glass.data',names=col_names).head()
```

This looks good, so I would save it now. I might even save is as csv

```{code-cell} ipython3
glass_df = pd.read_csv('glass.data',names=col_names)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
glass_df['Type_of_glass'].value_counts()
```

This shows that there are 6 classes, and they are different sizes. 

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
